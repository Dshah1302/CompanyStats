## Using this repository to follow the screencast

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/CompanyStats

Change into the directory:

    cd CompanyStats

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 00_starting_point origin/00_starting_point
    git checkout -b 01_bar_chart origin/01_bar_chart
    git checkout -b 02_line_chart origin/02_line_chart

## Checkpoints
